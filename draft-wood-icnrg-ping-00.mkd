This document describes the design of a CCNx Ping protocol based on control
messages. It includes the protocol design, mechanics, and message encoding 
details.

# Introduction

Regardless of the deployment strategy and ecosystem, network management and 
diagnostic tools will be essential for CCNx. One seemingly necessary feature
for CCNx network management is the ability to determine whether a device such
as a router or end-host, which happens to be responsible for a specific name, 
is reachable. In IP networks, the ping utility fulfills this purpose. We therefore 
need an analogous tool for CCNx networks. 

Unlike the IP ping, however, a CCNx ping tool would not require names to be topological. 
The only requirement is that (a) they are routable and (b) match a configured name of 
some device. For example, assume a router is configured with the device name /a/b/c. 
One could ping the device with the name /a/b/c and receive a result. In contrast, a ping 
request to /a/b or /a/b/c/d would not solicit a response from this device. 

As a network management tool, ping must not induce any security problems in the network. 
Therefore, ping responses need not be signed or verified. (Though a device may choose
to do so if the resources are available.) As

# Assumptions

This document makes the following assumptions.

- Devices (routers, end-hosts, etc.) are configured with names for which they are responsible. 
 For example, a router may be configured with the name /app/name/foo and /org/company/router0.
 Both are valid. 

- Ping names must be routable. Beyond this, we make no additional assumptions.

# Protocol Design

The CCNx ping design is simple: clients send ping requests for a particular name, hereafter
called the *target name*, in hopes of receiving a reply to know that it is reachable. 
Moreover, this basic functionality should be possible to execute in an application or "in-band".
Specifically, ping is not an application-layer protocol, though it may be used by applications.
As a "network-layer" protocol, this means that if a forwarder would forward an interest to a local
application, then ping requests with the *same name* are served by that forwarder; They are not
punted to the application.

To satisfy these goals, we imposed the following mechanical constraints. 

- Ping requests should not result in PIT aggregation.
- Ping responses are not cached.
â€“ Ping is not bidirectional.
- Forwarders must be able to quickly identify ping messages (requests and responses) and apply
 local control strategies, e.g., filtering, off-path processing, or suppression.

## Protocol

The ping protocol is simple and works as follows. Let N be the target name of 
a single ping request. Let C be the client generating and consuming the ping request
and response. 

- C generates a random nonce r, appends this nonce to N to create N', and sends a ping request for N'.
- Upon receipt of a ping request with name N, modulo the nonce, a router performs the following:
    - If N exactly matches one of the configured names, then generate a ping response. 
    - Otherwise, if N is longer than all of the configured names, forward the request using
    the local interest forwarding strategy.
    - Otherwise, if N is shorter than all of the configured names, drop the request.

Similar to interests, ping requests leave PIT state so that the responses can be appropriately forwarded
downstream to C.

As a technical matter, the target of the ping is free to provide any of the following information
in the ping response:

- A signature and associated validation information.
- A timestamp indicating when the response was generated.
- An authoritative name of the target that provided the response.
- An interface identifier corresponding to the link on which the target received the request.

## Message Format

To allow for easy identification of ping messages, as well as other future network
management protocol messages, we introduce the following packet types to use for
encoding ping messages:

- PT_CTL_REQUEST: a request control packet.
- PT_CTL_RESPONSE: a response control packet.

Within the packet, different control protocols are de-multiplexed using the message
type. For ping, the following message types are used:

- T_PING_REQUEST: a ping request message
- T_PING_RESPONSE: a ping response message.

Each ping message must contain a T_NAME field, which identifies the target name of the
request and response. This name value is used for (a) carrying the target name and (b)
forwarding the ping request should the name not match one of a device's configured names.
Additionally, ping responses may also contain the following fields
in the body of the response:

T_TIMESTAMP: a new TLV that holds an 8-byte absolute timestamp. (TODO: this is
encoded the same as the T_RECOMMENDED_LIFETIME value in {{CCNxMessages}}. 

## Client Behavior

Let T_1 and T_3 be these timestamps, respectively, and let T_2 be the optional response 
timestamp contained in a ping response. Upon receipt of a ping response, the
client performs the following calculations:

```
RTT = T_3 - T_1
UpstreamDelay = T_2 - T_1
DownstreamDelay = T_3 - T_2
```

These values can be used by the client however needed.

Similar to NTP {{RFC1305}}, a fourth timestamp could be added to differentiate between the 
target receive and target send times. If supported, the target may supply this additional
timestamp to aid client-side computation. 

# Security Considerations

Ping responses should only be signed if the target can afford to do so. Mandatory signatures
could be used as a trivial form of DoS. Also, consumers are recommended, though not required,
to authenticate ping responses.

1.  Introduction

   Regardless of the deployment strategy and ecosystem, network
   management and diagnostic tools will be essential for CCNx.  One
   seemingly necessary feature for CCNx network management is the
   ability to determine whether a device such as a router or end-host,
   which happens to be responsible for a specific name, is reachable.
   In IP networks, the ping utility fulfills this purpose.  We therefore
   need an analogous tool for CCNx networks.

   Unlike the IP ping, however, a CCNx ping tool would not require names
   to be topological.  The only requirement is that (a) they are
   routable and (b) match a configured name of some device.  For
   example, assume a router is configured with the device name /a/b/c.
   One could ping the device with the name /a/b/c and receive a result.
   In contrast, a ping request to /a/b or /a/b/c/d would not solicit a
   response from this device.

   As a network management tool, ping must not induce any security
   problems in the network.  Therefore, ping responses need not be
   signed or verified.  (Though a device may choose to do so if the
   resources are available.)  As

2.  Assumptions

   This document makes the following assumptions.

   o  Devices (routers, end-hosts, etc.) are configured with names for
      which they are responsible.  For example, a router may be
      configured with the name /app/name/foo and /org/company/router0.
      Both are valid.

   o  Ping names must be routable.  Beyond this, we make no additional
      assumptions.

3.  Protocol Design

   The CCNx ping design is simple: clients send ping requests for a
   particular name, hereafter called the _target name_, in hopes of
   receiving a reply to know that it is reachable.  Moreover, this basic
   functionality should be possible to execute in an application or "in-
   band".  Specifically, ping is not an application-layer protocol,
   though it may be used by applications.  As a "network-layer"
   protocol, this means that if a forwarder would forward an interest to
   a local application, then ping requests with the _same name_ are
   served by that forwarder; They are not punted to the application.

   To satisfy these goals, we imposed the following mechanical
   constraints.

   o  Ping requests should not result in PIT aggregation.

   o  Ping responses are not cached.  - Ping is not bidirectional.

   o  Forwarders must be able to quickly identify ping messages
      (requests and responses) and apply local control strategies, e.g.,
      filtering, off-path processing, or suppression.

3.1.  Protocol

   The ping protocol is simple and works as follows.  Let N be the
   target name of a single ping request.  Let C be the client generating
   and consuming the ping request and response.

   o  C generates a random nonce r, appends this nonce to N to create
      N', and sends a ping request for N'.

   o  Upon receipt of a ping request with name N, modulo the nonce, a
      router performs the following:

      *  If N exactly matches one of the configured names, then generate
         a ping response.

      *  Otherwise, if N is longer than all of the configured names,
         forward the request using the local interest forwarding
         strategy.

      *  Otherwise, if N is shorter than all of the configured names,
         drop the request.

   Similar to interests, ping requests leave PIT state so that the
   responses can be appropriately forwarded downstream to C.

   As a technical matter, the target of the ping is free to provide any
   of the following information in the ping response:

   o  A signature and associated validation information.

   o  A timestamp indicating when the response was generated.

   o  An authoritative name of the target that provided the response.

   o  An interface identifier corresponding to the link on which the
      target received the request.

3.2.  Message Format

   To allow for easy identification of ping messages, as well as other
   future network management protocol messages, we introduce the
   following packet types to use for encoding ping messages:

   o  PT_CTL_REQUEST: a request control packet.

   o  PT_CTL_RESPONSE: a response control packet.

   Within the packet, different control protocols are de-multiplexed
   using the message type.  For ping, the following message types are
   used:

   o  T_PING_REQUEST: a ping request message

   o  T_PING_RESPONSE: a ping response message.

   Each ping message must contain a T_NAME field, which identifies the
   target name of the request and response.  This name value is used for
   (a) carrying the target name and (b) forwarding the ping request
   should the name not match one of a device's configured names.
   Additionally, ping responses may also contain the following fields in
   the body of the response:

   T_TIMESTAMP: a new TLV that holds an 8-byte absolute timestamp.
   (TODO: this is encoded the same as the T_RECOMMENDED_LIFETIME value
   in [CCNxMessages].

3.3.  Client Behavior

   Let T_1 and T_3 be these timestamps, respectively, and let T_2 be the
   optional response timestamp contained in a ping response.  Upon
   receipt of a ping response, the client performs the following
   calculations:

   "RTT = T_3 - T_1 UpstreamDelay = T_2 - T_1 DownstreamDelay = T_3 -
   T_2 "

   These values can be used by the client however needed.

   Similar to NTP [RFC1305], a fourth timestamp could be added to
   differentiate between the target receive and target send times.  If
   supported, the target may supply this additional timestamp to aid
   client-side computation.

4.  Security Considerations

   Ping responses should only be signed if the target can afford to do
   so.  Mandatory signatures could be used as a trivial form of DoS.
   Also, consumers are recommended, though not required, to authenticate
   ping responses.
